Installation
=============

VS code can be simply installed on Windows 10 with the setup file. So we need to download the setup file from the official website.

Link: `https://code.visualstudio.com/`_

.. _https://code.visualstudio.com/: https://code.visualstudio.com/

After opening the website, click on the Download for Windows button. This will download the VS code Setup Wizard on our system as an EXE file.

So the VS code Setup Wizard is downloaded successfully and we need to run it. Run the file by referring to the screenshots provided below.

Click **Next next..**

Accept the License Agreement and then select the installation location

Choose the location in our system to install the VS code. If we are not bothering about the location, go with the default location. But, at least 203.4 MB of free disk space is required in the selected location.
